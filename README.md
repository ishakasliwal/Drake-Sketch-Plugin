*I'm just saying your Sketch files could do better... tell me have you heard that lately?*

Make designing on Sketch fun again by using these Drake photos and lyrics as asset placeholders and lorem ipsum text. This sketch plugin allows you to VERY QUICKLY generate dummy data. Users have found that stakeholders have responded better to avatars of Drake and Hotline Bling lyrics vs. the usual fillers.

This [plugin](https://github.com/timuric/Content-generator-sketch-plugin) is the bomb - it generates everything from dummy photos to numbers and more. It was the framework upon which I built this Drake generator!
